# Atom Keyboard Shortcuts

This page lists keyboard shortcuts for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io) that I find valuable and use a lot. Feel free to fork the page and add your own favorites. Pull Requests welcome!

Since I'm using a Mac, I have mainly listed the keyboard shortcuts for Mac OS X. Please feel free to add the Windows or Linux shortcuts.

Where the shortcut is provided by a package, I have added a link to the package.
